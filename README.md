# ‚úàÔ∏è British Airways Reviews Dashboard (GenAI-Powered)

## üìä Project Overview

This project showcases a **Generative AI-powered analysis** of customer reviews for **British Airways** between **March 2016 and October 2023**. Using prompt engineering and large language models (LLMs), the entire workflow‚Äîfrom data exploration to dashboard design‚Äîwas executed without traditional programming or manual data wrangling.

The analysis focuses on evaluating passenger experiences across aircraft types, geographies, and service features using insights generated by AI and visualised through Tableau.

## ü§ñ GenAI-Driven Workflow

The entire process was completed using **ChatGPT (Advanced Data Analysis)** and **prompt engineering**, following this structured, no-code workflow:

1. **Objective Definition**  
   Prompted the AI to structure the analysis goals based on the dataset.

2. **Data Understanding & Cleaning**  
   Uploaded CSVs into the AI environment for summarisation, anomaly detection, and data typing.

3. **Exploratory Analysis & Insight Generation**  
   Asked AI to surface trends, compare groups, and identify key insights across aircraft, countries, and service ratings.

4. **Visualization Planning**  
   Generated chart ideas and narrative structure for a Tableau dashboard using GenAI prompts.

5. **README & Documentation**  
   Entire documentation (this file) was created through prompt-driven output from ChatGPT.
